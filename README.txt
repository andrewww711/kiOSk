Basic Homepage Layout for the ticket Kiosk, open to change just kinda threw together what I think would work best. 
Running on flask, I did create a virtual python environment "kioskenv" that i recommend using while programming as it has all the required dependicies for flask already installed.
To activate the virtual environmment, make sure your in the kiOSk directory and use .\kioskenv\Scripts\activate
If you use vs code like me then you can select the virtual environment by going to the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and type "Python: Select Interpreter".
Choose the interpreter for the virtual environment you just created (it should show as .kioskenv\Scripts\python.exe or similar)
